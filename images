To send an image via OpenRouters' API, you would typically follow these steps:

1. Prepare Your API Key
Ensure you have a valid API key from OpenRouters. If not, you may need to:
• Register for an account on OpenRouters.
• Generate an API key from the control panel or account settings.

2. Format Your Image
Your image will need to be in a compatible format (e.g., JPEG, PNG).  
Possible approaches to send it via API:
• Direct Base64 Encoding: Convert the image to a Base64-encoded string.
• File Upload Endpoint: Use an API endpoint that accepts `multipart/form-data` (if supported by OpenRouters).

3. Use the OpenRouters API (Example)
The exact API endpoint and parameters depend on OpenRouters' documentation. Below is a generic example using `curl`:

If Supporting File Upload (Multipart)
```bash
curl -X POST \
  'https://api.openrouters.com/v1/image' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOURAPIKEY' \
  -F 'image=@/path/to/your/image.jpg;type=image/jpeg'
```

If Using Base64-Encoded Image
```bash
curl -X POST \
  'https://api.openrouters.com/v1/image' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOURAPIKEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"image": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4[...encoded data...]"}'
```

4. Response
The API should return a success response (e.g., 200 OK) or error details.

Note:
• OpenRouters may have a public API documentation where exact parameters and examples are listed.  
• Ensure your API key is secure (do not share it publicly).  

To help you further, could you provide:
1. The specific OpenRouters API endpoint URL.
2. Any additional details from the OpenRouters documentation?
